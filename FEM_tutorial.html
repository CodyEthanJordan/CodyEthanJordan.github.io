		<h1>Introduction to the Finite Element Method in 1 Dimension</h1>

		<p>There are plenty of great resources for learning the basis for the Finite Element Method (from here easily shortened to FEM), but this is going to be a simpler interactive introduction to how it works. Inspired by some of the works of <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Brett Victor</a> I think that FEM can be explained in a much more intuitive manner using interactive visualization. Before we get started though, let's look at some of the excellent and more traditional introductions.</p>

		<ul>
		  <li>For a direct, step-by-step and practical guide check out <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~zhilin/TEACHING/MA587/chap6.pdf">Zhilin Li of NC State.</a></li>
		  <li><a href="http://www.math.udel.edu/~fjsayas/anIntro2FEM.pdf">Francisco–Javier Sayas</a> and his "A gentle introduction to the Finite Element Method" provides an indredible way to understand how FEM works.</li>
		  <li>And most of all I'd like to thank and reccomend <a href="https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jpeterson/">Dr. Janet Peterson</a> of FSU for getting me started</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This is going to be a simple introduction, as visual possible, intended for those who have some familiarity with calculus and programming who are interested in understanding a way to get started on numerical techniques.  After this, feel free to delve deeper into some of those more detailed resources up above.  You’re encouraged to follow along, so get out pencil and paper and boot up Octave/MATLAB.</p>

		<h2>The Problem</h2>

		<p>For this tutorial we'll be considering one dimensional boundary value problems of the form \(y'' + p(x)y = f(x)\). Specifically the problem</p>

		<center>\(y'' = 1\)</center>
		<center>\(y(0)=0 \;\;\;\; y(1)=0\)</center>


		<p>If you need a bit of <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/BoundaryValueProblem.aspx">a refresher</a> on differential equations go check it out.  Since this is a relativly simple problem we can find the exact solution analytically.  Because of that we'll be able to check our work and do a brief analysis on how well the approximation works before applying FEM to more complex problems.  The exact answer is:</p>

		<center>\(\frac {x(1-x)} {2}\)</center>

		<br>
		<div id="exact-solution" align="center"></div>

		<p>Drag the number to change the graph: <span class="big" id="scrubbing-horizontal">20</span></p>

		<p>In order to figure out how we can appoximate the solution from the initial problem there are 5 major steps.

		<ul>
		  <li>Construct the weak formulation - as in, using mathematatics to restate the problem</li>
		  <li>Generate a mesh - break down the domain into individual sections</li>
		  <li>Choose a basis function - this is where the approximation happens, representing the problem using simpler building blocks</li>
		  <li>Assemble the matrix - we then use the mesh and basis function to restate the problem as a matrix and use linear algebra to solve</li>
		  <li>Solve and plot - this is where we actually get the approximate answer to the original question</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
