title:  "Creating my Portfolio Website"
categories: programming

I'd been looking for a straightforward way to host my portfolio online as a way to complement my CV. I also really enjoy making educational material and wanted someplace consistent to host all of it under a domain that I can manage.

I ended up settling on using Jekyll as the main technology for the website, and hosting through github pages because I only need to present static information.

Looking forward to creating some more tutorials and projects.
