RED ALERT: I'm going to spoil major plot points of Divnity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition


DoS2 is in many senses a great game, a passion-filled co-op RPG with overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam. Playing through the game made me feel many things, unfortunately one of the things it made me feel is "this is really not my thing".

I just need some way to express how I felt about the story, like a self-exorcism. Get it all out there. 

The main theme will be that I think a lot of the story elements are too silly for my taste, aren't connected to the gameplay in meaningful ways, and overall capture the feeling of going to a stranger's Dungeon and Dragons game very well. In no particular order

### Playing an Undead Doesn't Matter
