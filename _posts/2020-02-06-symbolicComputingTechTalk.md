I gave a workshop on symbolic computing for Knight Hacks, UCF's programming club.

There some mildly organized [code and workshop notes on GitHub](https://github.com/CodyEthanJordan/TutorialNotebooks/blob/master/Basics%20of%20Symbolic%20Computing.ipynb). Because this was an introduction for an audience which didn't have all that much programming experience or computing background I decided to cover the basics. 

- what makes symbolic computing different from numerical methods?
- declaring variables in SymPy
- what are some main "gotchas" when using SymPy?
- how can you use this to do your calculus or linear algebra homework
- explaining my process for exporting answers to LaTeX

Overall went really well, got good feedback, and even got some people in the audience involved in discussion. I think relating it to everyone's favorite calculus to hate, "volume of solids of rotation" was a good way to explain the concepts. Its also a good launching point for discussing stuff like Fourier transforms and functionals since its exposure to how functions can essentially be input/output to other functions in a mathematical context.
