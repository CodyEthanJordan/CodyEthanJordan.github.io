I've loved doing poi ever since I learned it back at FSU, but I didn't have any more recent videos of me juggling fire so I decided to make one to add as an easter egg to my resume.

Surprised at how much the phone picked up the crickets and the sound of the lighter at the start. Also learned a little bit about video editing having to cut out a part in the middle where the camera fell. The audio track I found was also slightly too short and I ended up having to repeat a section from early, which worked out pretty well do to how the track already had quite a bit of self-similarity and clear breaks in it. Opened up GIMP to make the thumbnail with the same font I was using for [tabletop game I'm working on](https://codyethanjordan.itch.io/realmlords).

Its always really fun to bring that sort of thing together. Individually none of it is all that spectacular (although I am proud of the poi): editing a video, really basic image creation, finding music. What I like is having just enough skill to be able to get into trouble in any field and solve problems.
