Starting to learn sketching so decided to turn a few of my practice sketches for Inktober in to Dungeons and Dragons content.


## The Isle of Skelos
Covert art for a module I'm writing

## The Time Spooder
Not sure what it is, but wanted something vaguely in the style of weird DnD monsters from the classical age of DnD.
