The belt on the lawnmower looks pretty bad.

Had to flip it over and start taking things apart. A few youtube tutorials later and banging on it with a wrench and the new belt is on. Something cool I noticed was how the steering mechanism works. Its interesting how it just looks like a direct linkage with that weird sliding plate that pulls on the front tires.


Unfortunately after fixing the mower I also broke the mower.

Deflated one of the front tires flipping it over, and wasn't able to re-seat and inflate it with the compressor I have. Probably just going to pull the tire off and take it to some folks down the street to pop it on.

ADDENDUM: Tire was an easy fix, but the replacement belt is too loose. Have to see about adjusting the variable speed pulley. There are some ok videos on YouTube about the problem but all of them are pitch black with someone filming on a phone under the mowing deck, might have to create a better lit one in case anyone else has problems with non-OEM belts.

THE CONCLUSION: Aftering trying a bunch of stuff an original factory belt got it working. Along with fixing a few loose brackets and some other adjustments its back out in the world now, making grass shorter than it was before.
