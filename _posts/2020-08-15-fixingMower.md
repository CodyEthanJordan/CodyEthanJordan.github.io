The belt on the lawnmower looks pretty bad.

Had to flip it over and start taking things apart. A few youtube tutorials later and banging on it with a wrench and the new belt is on. Something cool I noticed was how the steering mechanism works. Its interesting how it just looks like a direct linkage with that weird sliding plate that pulls on the front tires.


Unfortunately after fixing the mower I also broke the mower.

Deflated one of the front tires flipping it over, and wasn't able to re-seat and inflate it with the compressor I have. Probably just going to pull the tire off and take it to some folks down the street to pop it on.
