I decided to try out printing a tee-shirt after seeing some of the [cool
raubdruckerin in Berlin on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITOXCt-JQhc).
St. Petersburg has a fun vibe so I scouted out a manhole cover off the side of the
road near some mangroves (and far from traffic).

Cleaned it off, put on some ink, and it turned out pretty well. Might have to find
some other interesting places to try this out. Also want to experiment with how
to apply the ink and get a nice even pressure on the shirt.
