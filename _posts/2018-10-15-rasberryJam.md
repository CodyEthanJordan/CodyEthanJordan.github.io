UCF held a [Raspberry Pi workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/ucfraspberryjam/home) for the first time. One of the speakers dropped out at the last minute and I was roped in to give a workshop on pygame.

Overall it went fairly well, the audience didn't have too much experience with game development so I tried to cover a few fast tips which I think would help in that area

- getting used to a program flow built around user input
- a brief pitch about how nice MVC is
- a slightly longer pitch about how useful finite state machines are for game UI
- using a Raspberry as an arcade cabinet
