A few days ago there was a massive explosion and huge white flash during a storm. Found out the next day that a tree had nearly knocked over the power pole and had taken out the internet.

The ISP service fellow wasn't too keen on the idea of going through an impenetrable wall of foliage to climb up on a bent over pole stuck in the middle of a creek. So I got out there and started hacking.

About halfway in I think I had convinced him that it was at least possible to try and we both pitched in together. After some determined machete work I made my way to the internet and cleared a path for the ladder. Found out later he had been on a service call a while back with a different pole in the middle of a creek. That one collapsed under him while he was up there and he rode it down, so I don't think his concerns were too unfounded.

End of the day though it worked out pretty well, he got the new line up and I set up my dad's new router. Internet restored, and I suppose this could fall under the category of "hardware hacking."
