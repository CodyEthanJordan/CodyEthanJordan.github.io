Hello, I'm Cody Jordan and this is a website where I maintain a few portfolio pieces and collect thoughts about game design, physics, and mathematics. 

If you're looking for game development projects I keep these on my [itch.io page](https://codyethanjordan.itch.io/).

Here I have a few posts about physics, including [finding dark matter](galacticCurve) and [working with lasers](monochromatorLives). I also think a [lot](chipGame) about [probability](discreteWorld) and [math](closestWithoutGoingOver).
