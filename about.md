Hello, I'm Cody Jordan and this is a website where I maintain a few portfolio pieces and collect thoughts about game design, physics, and mathematics.

If you're just looking around then I'd reccomend my [itch.io page](https://codyethanjordan.itch.io/) as all of the game projects are more localized there.
