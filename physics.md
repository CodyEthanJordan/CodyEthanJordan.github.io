Details about physics projects. Still under construction.

### Ultra-High Vacuum Chamber and XUV Ultrafast Laser

I am currently a member of <a href="http://sciences.ucf.edu/physics/vaidalab/">Professor Mihai Vaida's research group</a>. In this group I have automated parts of the experimental setup by designing and implementing a system of stepper motors which allows users to control the monochromator through LabView. I did this using an Arduino microcontroller which handles communication between LabView and the hardware components. I also set up a single shot autocorrelator for use with the XUV laser.

- UHV operating procedures
- LabView
- Creating combined hardware and software solutions
- Working with ultrafast lasers

### Characterizing Radioactive Elements

I used a photomultiplier scintillator and multi-channel analyzer in order to characterize radioactive elements. The software that this worked with was very outdated, so instead I reverse-engineered the data files and conducted the analysis using Python. Using this we could identify elements based off high-energy photons, measure half-life of an irradiated indium sample, and characterize the data peaks.

- Data analysis with Python
- Working with legacy software
- Handling radioactive samples

### Quark Workbench Teaching Tools

The <a href="https://quarknet.org/data-portfolio/activity/quark-workbench">quark workbench</a> is a way to use puzzle pieces to teach the basics of the standard model. I used a laser cutter to make some nice wood puzzle pieces. <a href="https://goo.gl/xbiSGP">Here are the designs</a> which you can use with a laser cutter, and <a href="https://goo.gl/k95t8o">here are the original plans</a> which I made in Google sketch up.

- Small scale fabrication
- Education and outreach
- Use of CAD design software
