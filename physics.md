### Ultra-High Vacuum Chamber and XUV Ultrafast Laser

I am currently a member of <a href="http://sciences.ucf.edu/physics/vaidalab/">Professor Mihai Vaida's research group</a>. In this group I have automated parts of the experimental setup by designing and implementing a system of stepper motors which allows users to control the monochromator through LabView. I did this using an Arduino microcontroller which handles communication between LabView and the hardware components. I also set up a single shot autocorrelator for use with the XUV laser.

Key skills
- UHV operating procedures
- LabView
- Creating combined hardware and software solutions
- Working with ultrafast lasers

### Zeeman Splitting

As part of our capstone lab project at UCF I designed an experiment to measure the Zeeman effect. I researched Zeeman's original experiment and found comparable lab setups from other universities. One of the main challenges was that there is not a pre-packaged lab setup for this kind of measurement at the university.

Key skills
- Project planning and budgeting
- High precision-optical measurements

### Characterizing Radioactive Elements

I used a photomultiplier scintillator and multi-channel analyzer in order to characterize radioactive elements. The software that this worked with was very outdated, so instead I reverse-engineered the data files and conducted the analysis using Python. Using this we could identify elements based off high-energy photons, measure half-life of an irradiated indium sample, and characterize the data peaks.

Key skills
- Data analysis with Python
- Working with legacy software
- Handling radioactive samples
