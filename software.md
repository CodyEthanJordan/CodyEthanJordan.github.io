Highlighting some past and current software projects I've been involved in.

## Developer for Bucher-Emhart Glass

I developed software for the <a href="http://www.bucheremhartglass.com/products/container-inspection/in-line-inspection/flexinspect-bc-b-c">Flex Inspect</a> series of machines at Bucher-Emhart Glass. My primary role was in UWP development for our user interface, applying good UX and MVVM principles to give factory workers realtime feedback and control over the machine. I also managed a database of test images to run against our vision algorithms, and produced a progress report about the current state of the FlexInspect software while I was there. I did quite a bit of talking with field service personnel and QA in order to create and resolve bug reports during development. Another major contribution was setting up the software for localization and maintaining our Jenkins CI server.

I was contracted to analyze demographic data for students at UCF. I used Python to conduct the analysis and Jupyter Notebooks for visualizing and sharing the results.
